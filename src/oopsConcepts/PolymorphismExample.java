/* # What is polymorphism ?
 * 	=> If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism. In Java, we use method overloading 
 * and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.
 * 
 * # Types of polymorphism in Java ?
 * 	=>In Java, there are two types of polymorphism.
 *	Compile time polymorphism (static binding or method overloading)
 *	Runtime polymorphism (dynamic binding or method overriding)
 *
 *
 * # What is the advantage of method overloading?
 * 
 * # Difference between method overloading and method Overloading ?

 * # How to achieve static polymorphism?

 * # How to achieve dynamic polymorphism?

 * # How can we achieve polymorphism through data member?
 * 
 * 
 * # What is up-casting in java?
 * 	=>Whenever we put the reference id of a child class object into the parent class reference variable is known as upcasting in java.
 *	For example:
 *	Parent p = new Child();//upcasting declaration
